# Paper_Company_Dashboard_Project

# Project Overview
This project involved designing an operational performance dashboard for a fictional multinational paper production conglomerate with mills located in Canada, France, and the United States. The company, which has grown through acquisitions, operates aging equipment and faces high labor costs due to unionized workforces. Despite these challenges, their strategic focus remains on cost efficiency, production reliability, and profitability. To support these goals, senior management requested a monthly digital dashboard to monitor and compare mill performance. This dashboard would inform both incentive programs and strategic decisions.

# Objective
Develop a one-page performance dashboard using Power BI that:
+ Monitors key operational metrics across the four companies (Corp A, B, C, D)
+ Tracks production volume, quality, downtime, and efficiency
+ Enables senior management to identify risks and improvement opportunities
+ Supports incentive calculation based on profitability and productivity

# Methodology: IMPACT Cycle

This project followed the IMPACT Cycle framework for data analytics:

***1. Identify the Questions***
+ Business Goal: Assess overall mill performance with a focus on production volume, quality, and efficiency
+ Audience: Senior Management
+ Key Question: How can we monitor mill performance to drive improvements and reduce operational costs?

***2. Master the Data***
+ Explored dataset fields such as capacity, shutdown days, production tonnage, and headcount
+ Validated data completeness and accuracy:
+ Noted full data for 2021; partial data for 2022 (Janâ€“Aug)
+ Adjusted the scope to compare like-for-like periods
+ Established the 2022 budget as a benchmark for KPI thresholds

***3. Perform Test Plan***
Selected and calculated 6 core KPIs:

+ OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness)
+ Unplanned Shutdown Days
+ Unplanned Downtime Loss
+ Labor Productivity
+ Production Efficiency
+ Quality

***4. Address and Refine Results***
+ Conducted exploratory analysis to uncover insights
+ Identified a strong correlation between unplanned shutdowns and OEE availability
+ Created additional KPIs to isolate unplanned downtime impact and communicate tonnage loss
+ Refined results for clarity and decision-making relevance

***5. Communicate Insights and Track Outcomes***
+ Choose a narrative-driven dashboard presentation tailored to a time-constrained executive audience
+ Used visual storytelling to highlight trends, risks, and strategic insights
+ Focused on actionable takeaways rather than exploratory drill-downs

# Key Dashboard Features
+ Single-page layout with visual summaries for quick executive review
+ KPI cards and visual trends per company
+ Comparative metrics for performance benchmarking
+ Dynamic filters by month and mill

# Tools Used
+ Power BI for dashboard development
+ DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for KPI calculations
+ Excel/CSV for initial data cleanup and review
